* Introduction
This repo is the final project of information retrieving. I tried Bayesian model
and classic LSTM model to analyse the sentiment of reviews in both English and Chinese datasets.

The result of the two models can be found in file:report/info.ppt, and the source code can
be found in file:src/.

Here is the accuracy of the 4 experiments:

|                 | Bayesian model | classic LSTM model |
| Chinese Dataset |          71.2% |              77.1% |
| English Dataset |          83.5% |              79.4% |
